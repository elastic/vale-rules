# Elastic Security UI


The {{security-app}} is a highly interactive workspace designed for security analysts that provides a clear overview of events and alerts from your environment. You can use the interactive UI to drill down into areas of interest.


## Search [search-overview]

Filter for alerts, events, processes, and other important security data by entering [{{kib}} Query Language (KQL)](/explore-analyze/query-filter/languages/kql.md) queries in the search bar, which appears at the top of each page throughout the app. A date/time filter set to `Today` is enabled by default, but can be changed to any time range.

:::{image} /solutions/images/security-search-bar.png
:alt: search bar
:screenshot:
:::

* To refine your search results, select **Add Filter** (![Add filter icon](/solutions/images/security-add-filter-icon.png "title =20x20")), then enter the field, operator (such as `is not` or `is between`), and value for your filter.
* To save the current KQL query and any applied filters, select **Saved query menu** (![Saved query menu icon](/solutions/images/security-saved-query-menu-icon.png "title =20x20")), enter a name for the saved query, and select **Save saved query**.


## Visualization actions [visualization-actions]

Many {{elastic-sec}} histograms, graphs, and tables display an **Inspect** button (![Inspect icon](/solutions/images/security-inspect-icon.png "title =20x20")) when you hover over them. Click to examine the {{es}} queries used to retrieve data throughout the app.

:::

Other visualizations display an options menu (![Three-dot menu icon](/solutions/images/security-three-dot-icon.png "title =20x20")), which allows you to inspect the visualization’s queries, add it to a new or existing case, or open it in Lens for customization.

## Inline actions for fields and values [inline-actions]

Throughout the {{security-app}}, you can hover over many data fields and values to display inline actions, which allow you to customize your view or investigate further based on that field or value.

:::{image} /solutions/images/security-inline-actions-menu.png
:alt: Inline additional actions menu
:width: 500px
:screenshot:
:::

In some visualizations, these actions are available in the legend by clicking a value’s options icon (![Vertical three-dot icon](/solutions/images/security-three-dot-icon-vertical.png "title =20x20")).

:::

Inline actions include the following (some actions are unavailable in some contexts):

* **Filter In**: Add a filter that includes the selected value.
* **Filter Out**: Add a filter that excludes the selected value.
* **Add to timeline**: Add a filter to Timeline for the selected value.
* **Toggle column in table**: Add or remove the selected field as a column in the alerts or events table. (This action is only available on an alert’s or event’s details flyout.)
* **Show top _x_**: Display a pop-up window that shows the selected field’s top events or detection alerts.
* **Copy to Clipboard**: Copy the selected field-value pair to paste elsewhere.

## Accessibility features [timeline-accessibility-features]

Accessibility features, such as keyboard focus and screen reader support, are built into the Elastic Security UI. These features offer additional ways to navigate the UI and interact with the application.


### Interact with draggable elements [draggable-timeline-elements]

Use your keyboard to interact with draggable elements in the Elastic Security UI:

* Press the `Tab` key to apply keyboard focus to an element within a table. Or, use your mouse to click on an element and apply keyboard focus to it.

  :screenshot:
  :::

* Press `Enter` on an element with keyboard focus to display its menu and press `Tab` to apply focus sequentially to menu options. The `f`, `o`, `a`, `t`, `c` hotkeys are automatically enabled during this process and offer an alternative way to interact with menu options.

  :::

* If an event has an event renderer, press the `Shift` key and the down directional arrow to apply keyboard focus to the event renderer and `Tab` or `Shift` + `Tab` to navigate between fields. To return to the cells in the current row, press the up directional arrow. To move to the next row, press the down directional arrow.
