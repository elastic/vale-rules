swap:
  - abort: "This word can be offensive. Use shut down, cancel, or stop instead."
  - above: "Don't use to refer to a position. Directional language does not meet accessibility requirements."
  - add: "Use for establishing a new relationship. Often used in create-then-add scenarios: Create a dashboard, then add a visualization. Remove is the correct opposite."
  - app, application: "Use only when needed for clarity. Otherwise, a Kibana app name can stand alone. App is a well-known abbreviation for application and is preferred."
  - begin: "Similar to start, using begin depends on the context. Begin a procedure, begin an analysis, or begin an installation are common phrases. Similarly, start a program, start an engine, or start a timer are frequently used. Start is considered less formal than begin. End is the correct opposite of begin."
  - below: "Don't use to refer to a position. Directional language does not meet accessibility requirements."
  - blacklist: "This word has roots in racism. Use blocklist instead."
  - boot: "Use start or run instead."
  - can: "Use to convey permission."
  - cancel: "Use to stop an action without saving pending changes."
  - cannot, can't: "Use to indicate you don't have the ability to do something. Often confused with unable."
  - choose: "Use select instead."
  - click: "OK when describing mouse actions. Otherwise, use verbs that work with multiple devices, such as select."
  - clone: "Use when creating a copy that is linked to the original. Often confused with copy and duplicate."
  - copy: "Use when creating an exact copy in the same location as the original. Often confused with clone and duplicate."
  - could: "Replace with can or might whenever possible."
  - create: "Use for creating an object from scratch. Not create new. Delete is the correct opposite."
  - delete: "Use when deleting data that users can no longer retrieve. Create is the correct opposite."
  - disable: "Don't use to describe something that is broken. Use inactive, unavailable, deactivate, turn off, or deselect, depending on the context."
  - duplicate: "Use when creating a copy of an object in the same location as the original. Often confused with copy and clone."
  - easy, easily: "It can be frustrating for users to think that something is easy, but then struggle to do the task. Typically the same meaning can be conveyed without this word."
  - edit: "Not change or modify. Edit is the better choice for localization."
  - e.g.: "Don't use Latin abbreviations. Use for example or such as instead."
  - enable: "Use when turning on or activating an option or a feature."
  - enter: "Use to refer to the user entering text. Not type."
  - execute: "Use run or start instead."
  - hack: "For a noun, use tip or work-around instead. For a verb, use configure or modify."

  - i.e.: "Don't use Latin abbreviations."
  - invalid: "Use not valid or incorrect instead."

  - launch: "Use open instead."

  - remove: "Use when removing a relationship, but not permanently deleting the data. For example, you remove a visualization from a dashboard. Add is the correct opposite."
  - select: "Select is preferred over choose."
  - simple, simply: "Often used before a verb like select, but doesn't add any information or value. Implies that users should have been able to do such a simple task without assistance."
  - start: "Start and begin depend on the context. Start a program, start an engine, or start a timer are common phrases. Similarly, begin a procedure, begin an analysis, or begin an installation are frequently used. Start is considered less formal than begin."
  - terminate: "Use stop or exit instead."
  - type: "Use enter because there is typically more than one way to enter text than typing."
  - unable: "Unable means not being able to perform an action. Often confused with cannot."
  - utilize: "Don't use utilize when you mean use."
  - view: "Preferred over see because view is more inclusive."
